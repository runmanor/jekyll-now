[[pdf](/ppt/计算机视觉和机器学习-作业规范.pdf)]

All class work should be done independently unless explicitly indicated on the assignment handout. You may discuss homework problems with classmates, but must write your solution by yourself. If you do discuss assignments with other classmates, you must supply their names at the top of your homework/source code. No excuses will be accepted for copying others work (from the current or past semesters), and violations will be dealt with harshly. (Getting a bad grade is much preferable to cheating.)
